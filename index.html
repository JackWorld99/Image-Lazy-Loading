    <h1>Lazy Loading</h1>
    <p>Lazy loading is a strategy to identify resources as non-blocking (non-critical) and load these only when needed.
        It's a way to shorten the length of the critical rendering path, which translates into reduced page load times.

        Lazy loading can occur on different moments in the application, but it typically happens on some user
        interactions such as scrolling and navigation.</p>

    <p>As the web has evolved, we have come to see huge increases in the number and size of assets sent to users.
        Between 2011 and 2019, the median resource weight increased from ~100KB to ~400KB for desktop and ~50KB to
        ~350KB for mobile. While Image size has increased from ~250KB to ~900KB on desktop and ~100KB to ~850KB on
        mobile.</p>
    <h3>What if I'm already using a third-party library or a script to lazy-load images?</h3>
    <p>One of the important reasons to continue to use a third-party library along with loading="lazy" is to provide a
        polyfill for browsers that do not yet support the attribute.</p>
